# Introduction to the Development Environment at Avionics Team, STL

## Software Development Toolchain and IDEs
#### Required Tools
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [GitHub for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github)
  - [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)

## Hardware Development Tools
- [Fusion 360](https://www.fusion360.com/)

#### Optional Tools
- [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/)

## Environment Setup
#### Preliminary Check:
1. Open the command prompt in Windows or terminal in Linux and Mac OS
```
gcc --version
```
```
git --version
```
```
openocd --version
```
The you can have a clear version information by typing the commands above. Your environment set-up should be compatible with our development setting.

### IDE Installation and Configuration
#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a powerful IDE which is used to develop software. It is a free software which is open source and can be used by anyone. It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code to develop software. The software development in the lab massively invovlves the use of both Visual Studo Code and PlatformIO. Therefore, please ensure that you have installed the software before you start the development by the end of Novmeber 2021.

#### Arduino IDE Installation
Please use the link above to download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE which will be the foundation of our software development process. 

### Fusion 360 Installation
Please use the link above to download and install the latest version of the Fusion 360 which will be the foundation of our software development process. Also, you will be required to login into the Fusion 360 with the Autodesk account you have created.

### Connect to A Cloud Virtual Machine (Archieved)
Please use the remote desktop connection (RDP) to connnect to the cloud virtual machine. The cloud virtual machine is a online test platform for Space Technology Lab, Tamkang University to develop their own avionics software. The cloud virtual machine is hosted by Microsoft Azure in Unitied States. To connect to the cloud VM, please follow the following steps below:
1. Click the RDP file to initate the connection.
2. Enter the username and password (Account: STLAVI, Password: @STLavionics2021)
3. Click the "Connect" button.
4. Cick the "yes" button to continue.
5. Access to the cloud VM.
