# Introduction to the Development Environment at Avionics Team, STL

## Software Development Toolchain and IDEs
#### Required Tools
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
- [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [GitHub for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github)
  - [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)

## Hardware Development Tools
- [Fusion 360](https://www.fusion360.com/)

#### Optional Tools
- [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/)

## Environment Setup
#### Preliminary Check:
1. Open the command prompt in Windows or terminal in Linux and Mac OS
```
gcc --version
```
```
git --version
```
```
openocd --version
```
The you can have a clear version information by typing the commands above. Your environment set-up should be compatible with our development setting.

### IDE Installation and Configuration
#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a powerful IDE which is used to develop software. It is a free software which is open source and can be used by anyone. It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code to develop software. The software development in the lab massively invovlves the use of both Visual Studo Code and PlatformIO. Therefore, please ensure that you have installed the software before you start the development by the end of Novmeber 2021.
