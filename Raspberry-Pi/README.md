# STL Avionics Raspberry Pi 4B Documentation 
## Introduction to Raspberry Pi
Rapsberry pi is a small, low-cost, and affordable computer. It is a single board computer (SBC) that is designed to be used as a general purpose computer. At avionics team, we are using raspberry pi to develop the avionics system. The raspberry pi mainly responsible for the transmission of real-time image data to the ground station.

## Introductin to Arm Processor (Cortex A Series)
The processor on the Raspberry Pi processor is a Cortex A series processor with a high clock speed (Above 1G Hz) to process the data while meeting all kinds of the engineering demand. The Cortex A series is an application based processor. It is a multi-core processor with a single core. The Cortex A series processor has a high clock speed and high power consumption.
