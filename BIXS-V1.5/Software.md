# Introduction to BIXS-V1.5: Software
The software ran on the BIXS-V1.5 avionics systems was developed by the avionics team at Space Technology Laboratory. The system was designed to meet a specific mission profile which means that this is not a general purposed flight computer of all scenarios of applications. 

## Software Design Principles
The software design principles of the BIXS computer are based on the following,

## Software Architecture


## Directory Structure
- Root
    - .pio
    - .vscode
    - include
    - lib
    - src
    - test
    - platformio.ini

## Development Methodology

## Development Environments

## API Documentation
The API documentation enables engineers and manager to better understand the sources code in the systems. To better the understanding of the documentation, the software engineer design the API documentation as the following manner.
- Introduction to the API
    - Name
    - Scope
    - Properties
    - Parameters
- Concepts
- Sample Code
