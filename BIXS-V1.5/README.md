# Introduction to BIXS-V1.5 
The avionics system used in the 2021 rocket mission at [Space Technology Laboratory (STL)](https://github.com/TKU-STL) was named BIXS-V1.5 which allows engineer to collect a wide range of data to understand the dynamic of the rocket performance. In order to understand the BIXS-V1.5 avionics system, the development team spilt the documentation into two parts, one is software documentation which explicitly explain the concepts and API used in the systems. Also, the hardware documentation is provided to better understand the overall system architecture

## System Architecture Structure
The main processor unit on board is Arduino Uno board. Also, we do have IMU and pressure sensor (Altitude meter) to understand the behavior of the sounding rocket. The system architecture is shown below.
