## Mission Statement
This documentation site aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date technical documentation for the works at Space Technology Lab, Tamkang University. Therefore, it is vital to check the latest updates and additions to the documentation before implementing any software and hardware changes.

## Documentation Mechanism
The mechanism to document this resource is based on operation principle of GitHub. Once you have wrote a new document, you need to create a branch so that we can check the content and update the documentation. Once the pull request is accepted, the document will be updated to the main branch which will be official release of the document.

## Questions and Discussion
If you have any questions about the documentation or any systems we developed, feel free to reach out the development team via [the issues page](https://github.com/TKU-STL/Docs/issues).
